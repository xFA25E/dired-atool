#+TITLE: dired-atool-transient

This package provides a transient wrapper for atool in *Dired* modes.

* Usage
Mark some files in *Dired* modes and run one of these commands:

+ ~dired-atool-transient-pack~: Run ~atool~'s ~--add~ (~apack~) command.
+ ~dired-atool-transient-unpack~: Run ~atool~'s ~--extract~ (~aunpack~) or
  ~--extract-to=~ command.

* Installation
** Nix
This repo is a nix flake.  You can just add ~overlays.default~ output to your
nixpkgs overlays.

#+begin_src nix
{
  inputs.dired-atool-transient.url = "github:xFA25E/dired-atool-transient";
  outputs = { self, dired-atool-transient, nixpkgs }: let
    pkgs = import nixpkgs {
      system = "your-system";
      overlays = [ dired-atool-transient.overlays.default ];
    };
  in {
    # YOUR OUTPUTS
  };
}
#+end_src

** Package manager
If you've installed it with your package manager, you're done.
~dired-atool-transient-pack~ and ~dired-atool-transient-unpack~ are autoloaded,
so you can call them right away.

** Manual
Put /dired-atool-transient.el/ in your load-path, and put the following in your
init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(require 'dired-atool-transient)
#+END_SRC
